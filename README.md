# Matter App

An easy way to create Matter-based Roblox games.

# Installation

Three different dependencies are required to install and use matter-app:

-   **@rbxts/matter** - Of course you need this. This is matter.
-   **@rbxts/plasma** - This is used for the Debugger.
-   **@rbxts/rewire** - This is used for system hot-reloading

## Features

-   **Debugger** - Matter's Debugger is automatically setup and configurable.
-   **Systems** - Systems are automatically scheduled and all that needs to be provided is their containing folders.
-   **Hot Reloading** - Systems are automatically required to be hot-reloaded via [Rewire](https://github.com/sayhisam1/Rewire/tree/main/src).
-   **Resources** - An object that contains globally unique data, and is accessable by all systems.
